# The Book Nook

## Description

We created an online book store that allows a user to browse books by category or search for a specific book and add it to their cart as a hardcover, paperback, eBook, or audiobook. They can also create an account or login to an existing account. When logged in, they can view their user profile and change their email address and their order history.
